## Overview

This turns EC2 instance tags into puppet facts. For example: `ec2_tag_*tagname*`. 

## Setup

### What ec2tagfacts affects

* Tag names are prepended with `ec2_tag_`, converted to all lowercase, and spaces are converted to underscores.
* You can now use EC2 tags in puppet classes, for example `$::ec2_tag_name`.
* EC2 tags are then added to facter.
* Python pip is installed in order to install the aws cli tool with pip.
* The AWS cli python package is installed.
* Optinally provided AWS credentials are set in the /root/.aws/credentials INI file. Role access method is preferred.
* EPEL is required for RHEL based systems and is automatically setup on them unless you disable that feature.

### Setup Requirements

The most secure and preferred method is to use IAM Roles. This allows the AWS cli tool to read EC2 tags without exposing a key+secret on the filesystem. If this is a new instance you are just now launching I recommend using an IAM Role. If this is an existing system you can not assign IAM Roles to launched EC2 instances so you will need to use an IAM key+secret pair. AWS credentials with read access to EC2 tags are optional parameters or from hiera or class parameters. EPEL is required for RHEL based systems for python-pip package support and is automatically setup when that OS family is detected.

### AWS IAM Role

_This is the most secure and preferred method._

Console -> Identity & Access Management -> Roles -> Create New Role -> Role Name Example: `WebServer1` -> Select `Amazon EC2` -> Next Step -> Create Role -> Edit Role created -> Inline Policy / Create Role Policy -> Custom Policy -> Policy Name Example: ec2tagread -> Policy Document ->
~~~
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeTags"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
~~~
-> Apply Policy

Now when you launch EC2 instances make sure you select this `Role` to launch them into. Once launched an EC2 instance can't be added to a role or removed from a role but the contents of the roles' policies can be changed at any time.

### AWS IAM Policy

This is the option available to existing EC2 instance without Role assignments. The AWS access_key you use must be given rights to read ec2 tags. Here is an example of a small read-only ec2 tag policy. This is a less secure alternative because the secret+key are exposed on the filesystem. However the AWS cli ini file is owned by root and only readable by root.

~~~
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
         "ec2:DescribeTags"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
   }
   ]
}
~~~

### R10k Example

Add this to your `Puppetfile`:
~~~
mod 'bitswarmlabs/ec2tagfacts', :latest
mod 'jdowning/awscli', :latest
~~~

## Usage

### Class with parameters

#### Role Method ####
~~~
class { 'ec2tagfacts': }
~~~

#### Access Key Method ####
~~~
class { 'ec2tagfacts':
  aws_access_key_id      => 'ASJSF34782SJGU',
  aws_secret_access_key  => 'SJG34861gaKHKaDfjq29gfASf427RGHSgesge',
}
~~~

### Hiera Example

This is only needed on instances without a `Role` providing the tag read rights. The `Role` method should be used whenever possible.

~~~
ec2tagfacts::aws_access_key_id: 'ASJSF34782SJGU'
ec2tagfacts::aws_secret_access_key: 'SJG34861gaKHKaDfjq29gfASf427RGHSgesge'
~~~

Then include the class like this:
~~~
include ec2tagfacts
~~~

## Reference

###Classes

####Public classes
* `ec2tagfacts`: Installs and configures aws cli and loads EC2 tags as facts in facter.

####Private classes
* `ec2tagfacts::params`: Auto detection of package names based on OS family.

###Parameters

#####`aws_access_key_id`

Optional. Specify the AWS access_key_id with read rights to EC2 tags.

#####`aws_secret_access_key`

Optional. Specify the AWS access_key_id's secret.

## Limitations

This is written for both CentOS/RHEL/Amazon based systems and Debian/Ubuntu based systems. EPEL is required for the RHEL family in order to obtain the python-pip package to install the AWS cli pip package and is automatically detected and setup.
